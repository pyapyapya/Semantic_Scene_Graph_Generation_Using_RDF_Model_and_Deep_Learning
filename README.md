<hr/>
 We propose a scene graph generation method based on using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) model to clarify semantic relations. <br>
 Furthermore, we also use convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) deep learning models to generate a scene graph expressed in a controlled vocabulary of the RDF model to understand the relations between image object tags.
